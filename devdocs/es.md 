If you're new to freesewing, start with [Getting started](/en/docs/developer/start), [Basic concepts](/en/docs/developer/concepts), [Learn by example](/en/docs/developer/examples), and [Best practices](/en/docs/developer/do)

Designing patterns? You may want to bookmark the freesewing [API Reference](/en/docs/developer/api), as well as the [Configuration](/en/docs/developer/config) and [Settings](/en/docs/developer/settings) documentation.

If you're looking to write a plugin, skip ahead to [Extending freesewing](/en/docs/developer/extend) or browse our list of [Plugins](/en/docs/developer/plugins).

Last but not least, all our code is available on [github.com/freesewing](https://github.com/freesewing).
