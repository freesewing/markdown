## Re-use measurements

When designing patterns, re-use the measurements that are already in use as much as possible. Nobody wins when every pattern requires its own set of measurements, or names certain measurements differently.

<Tip>

###### See our models packages for standard measurement names

The [freesewing models](/packages/models) package contains all our standard measurement names.

## Re-use options

The same is (somewhat) true for options. While your pattern may require some very specific options, there's probably a bunch that are similar to other patterns. Re-use those names.

As in, `bicepsEase` exists. So don't go creating an `upperArmEase` option.

## Re-use CSS classes

While you can style your pattern however you want, try to re-use the CSS class names that are in use in our default [theme plugin](/packages/theme).

Doing so will ensure consistent styling for patterns.
