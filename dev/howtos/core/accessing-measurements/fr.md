Measusuremnets are stored in `pattern.settings.measurements`, but thanks to the [shorthand](/howtos/core/shorthand/) call, you can simply write:

```js
let quarterChest = measurements.chestCircumference / 4;
```

<Note>

Keep in mind that [FreeSewing uses millimeter for everything](/guides/overview/about/units/).
