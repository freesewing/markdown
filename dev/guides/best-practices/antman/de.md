title: BenutzeN Sir den ant-man-Test
---

Beim Gestalten von Schnittmustern sollten Sie auf absolute Werte verzichten.

That 6cm ease you add might be fine for all scenarios you tested, but then somebody comes around who is twice your size, or who is making clothes for a doll, and things will go off the rails.

To check how well your pattern scales, you can use the *ant-man* test by sampling the pattern for 2 models:

 - A model with measurements of avarage person (the man)
 - A model with measurements 1/10th of an average person (the ant)

A well-designed pattern will scale a factor 10 down and hold its shape. If your pattern makes assumptions about size, this test will show that.<Fixme> Add instructions on how to test this </Fixme>
