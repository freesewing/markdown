## Re-use measurements

When designing patterns, re-use the measurements that are already in use as much as possible.
Nobody wins when every pattern requires its own set of measurements, or names
certain measurements differently.

<Tip>

######  See our models packages for standard measurement names

The [@freesewing/models](/reference/packages/models/)
package contains all our standard measurement names.

## Re-use options

The same is (somewhat) true for options. While your pattern may require some very specific
options, there's probably a bunch that are similar to other patterns. Re-use those names.

As in, `bicepsEase` exists. So don't go creating an `upperArmEase` option.

## Re-use CSS classes

While you can style your pattern however you want, try to re-use the CSS class names that
are in use in our default [theme plugin](/reference/packages/plugin-theme/).

Doing so will ensure consistent styling for patterns.
