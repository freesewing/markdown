## Ways to contribute

There's may ways to contribute to freesewing. Here are some of the more common ones, from easy to more involved:

### Help spread the word

Tell your friends about freesewing, or spread awareness on social media. If you have a blog, perhaps you can write about us, or review one of our patterns.

It may seem simple, but it's probably how you heard about us in the first place. So pay it forward.

### Improve our content

On every page, there's a link at the bottom that allows you to submit improvements. You'll need a GitHub account for this, but they are free.

Use that button. Don't be shy. If you see a typo, or something that needs clarification or more detail, please suggest your improvements.


### Help with translation

Translation is one of the most important aspects to bring FreeSewing to all corners of the world. It's also something for which we are completely dependent on the community.

Our [documentation for translators](/guides/translator/) will tell you all you need to know to get started.

### Test, make, or showcase our patterns

Are you a maker?  Go ahead and make [our patterns](https://freesewing.org/patterns), share your experience, and provide us your feedback.

We'd love to get pictures to [showcase](https://freesewing.org/showcase) on our website too.
