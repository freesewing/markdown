This is an npm initializer package to jump-start your FreeSewing pattern designs with:

```js
npm init freesewing-pattern@beta
```

This package is what's loaded when you enter that command.

<note>

The `@beta` prefix is required while FreeSewing 2.0 is in beta. Once we release it, it won't be needed.
