Freesewing is proudly multilingual, and for this we depend on translators to help us.

We use [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) to manage all translations for FreeSewing. It's an online platform that makes translation a breeze.

## Languages

English is our origin language. Which means that everything is written in English and then translated from English into other languages.

We currently support the following five languages:

- **en** : English (our origin language)
- **de** : German
- **es** : Spanish
- **fr** : French
- **nl** : Dutch

If you'd like to start working on a new language, that's great, but a bit beyond the scope of this documentation. So in that case, please [come and talk to us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing).

## Translation

FreeSewing has two different projects on crowdin:

- [freesewing/i18n](https://crowdin.com/project/freesewing) holds **strings**; All of the words and sentences that are used in our code. See [Translating strings](/translator/strings) for more info.
- [freesewing/markdown](https://crowdin.com/project/fs-markdown) holds **content**; Things like documentation, blog posts, and so on. See [Translating content](/translator/content) for more info. 

<Note>

###### What is i18n?

You'll come across the term *i18n* a lot when we discuss translation.

i18n is short for internationalization, which is an umbrella term for translation, and adapting other things (like dates) to the local language.

</Note>

To get started, you will need to be invited as a translator. No need to worry, simply [let us know you'd like to help out](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing) and we'll add you.
