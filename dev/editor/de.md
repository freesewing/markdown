The *static content* of our websites is stored in [our markdown repository](/repos/markdown). Anybody can make changes to it and submit a pull request.

Whether it's a documentation page (like this one), a blog post, or showcase, if you see something that can be improved, go ahead and change it.

At the bottom of each page, you'll find a *Edit this page* link that allows you to edit the page online in GitHub's editor.

Or fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

<Note>

All our content is written in MarkDown. If you're new to MarkDown, [read our MarkDown documentation](/markdown/) first.
