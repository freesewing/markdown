title: Using macros
---

Macros are a way to facilitate pattern design by bundling a bunch of individual actions into a little routine.

Macros are provided by [plugins](/plugins/). Here are some examples:

<example pattern="rendertest" options={{ colors: false, circles: snippets: text: widthhd: false }}>

Refer to [the API documentation](/api/part#macro) for details on how to use macros, and the [extending FreeSewing](/extend) documentation for info on how to create your own macros.
