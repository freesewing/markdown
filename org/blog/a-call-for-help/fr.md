Salut tout le monde, c'est Joost. I'm writing this post to address some problems that have been worrying me lately. Specifically, these problems:

 1. [There is too much work for one person](#problem-1-there-is-too-much-work-for-one-person)
 2. [I feel I'm losing track of the sewing community](#problem-2-i-feel-im-losing-track-of-the-community)
 3. [I feel insecure about how to deal with the issue of systemic racism](#problem-3-i-feel-insecure-about-how-to-deal-with-the-issue-of-systemic-racism)

The good news is that it's a relatively short list. The even better news is that all of these problems be addressed by the same solution: [Community building](#community-building).

Avant d'entrer dans le vif du sujet, examinons brièvement chaque problème :

## Problem 1: There is too much work for one person

Over the course of the last week I read [Working in public: The making and maintenance of open source software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) by [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/).

Je l'ai acheté en espérant y trouver des réponses à certaines des questions que je me pose. Questions like “*How do other maintainers do it?*”, or “*Am I doing it wrong?*”

En d'autres termes, j''espérais trouver une solution à ce qui est pour moi un problème grandissant : l''incapacité à dimensionner mon propre travail à la façon dont je voudrais dimensionner le projet FreeSewing.

I don't want to spoil the book, but it didn't provide any straightforward answers on how to address that problem. It turns out that the vast majority of open source maintainers are in the same boat. Most projects are run by either a single person, or a handful of people.

There's nothing wrong with that. But it does put a firm upper limit on how much projects like FreeSewing can accomplish.

## Problem 2: I feel I'm losing track of the sewing community

I worry that I have been neglecting the communal aspects of FreeSewing, there are no comments or *social* aspects on the site. I've always felt it was a fool's errand to try to corral people onto your own website. Better to let them have discussions on the platforms of their choice.

Pour la communauté couture, c'est souvent Instagram. Since I have left Instagram year ago, I feel like I'm getting further away from the sewing community.

My [reasons for leaving](https://joost.decock.org/post/187710847164/24-hours-from-now-i-want-to-remove-my-instagram) are as valid today as they were back then, but I wish I could connect with the sewing community in a way that works for me.

## Problème 3: Je ne me sens pas à l'aise sur la manière de traiter les problèmes de racisme.

Premièrement : **Black lives matter**✊🏾

Mon malaise vient de mon environnement. Je suis un homme blanc cis-genre d'âge moyen, né et élevé dans un pays dont l'histoire est teintée du sang de gens de couleur ([ce pays est la Belgique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State)). À ce jour, un racisme occasionnel imprègne tous les aspects de la société dans laquelle je vis.

A welcoming a diverse community is a *sine qua non* for me. But I feel ill-equipped to figure out how to create one on FreeSewing.

## Développement communautaire

As I mentioned earlier, these things have been on my mind for a while, albeit they were a lot more fuzzy. Then earlier this month I listened to [Black makers matter with Julian Collins on the podcast Love To Sew](https://lovetosewpodcast.com/episodes/episode-156-black-makers-matter-with-julian-collins/).

[Julian](https://www.instagram.com/juliancreates/) is a patron of FreeSewing (thanks Julian) and actively involved with the [Black Makers Matter](https://www.instagram.com/blkmakersmatter/) movement on Instagram. J'ai contacté Julian à la recherche d'aide, et nous avons eu un long appel Zoom où nous avons parlé de son travail et comment il s'y prend pour organiser la communauté.

Julian a eu beaucoup de bons conseils. I couldn't possibly cram it all into this post, but it sort of boils down to:

 - Just ask people for help
 - Be clear about what kind of community you want to build

So I am taking Julian's advice to heart, and asking for help. Before we get to that though, let's make sure we're all on the same page about the kind of community we're trying to build here.

## Vérification rapide : Êtes-vous en ligne avec les valeurs de FreeSewing ?

Pour vous assurer que vos valeurs sont alignées avec celles de FreeSewing, veuillez prendre un moment pour vous familiariser avec :

 - [Our community standards](/docs/about/community-standards/)
 - [Our code of conduct](https://freesewing.dev/contributors/code-of-conduct/)
 - [Our revenue pledge](/docs/about/pledge/)

If reading that made you happy rather than angry, we could use your help :)

## Aidez à faire grandir FreeSewing au-delà de ce que je peux faire seul

We're starting simple: We plan to hold a Zoom/Skype/Whatever call every 2 weeks to figure it out as we go. Nous commençons le premier week-end de septembre (week-end prochain). Nous n'avons pas encore choisi d'heure, car cela dépendra des fuseaux horaires dans lesquels vivent les participants.

Si vous souhaitez y assister, veuillez [nous le faire savoir dans notre salon de discussion](https://chat.freesewing.org/).

### De quelle aide avons nous besoin ?

Les Mendiants ne peuvent faire les difficiles. All help is welcome, and I certainly don't want to turn down any volunteers.

That being said, an overly vague call defuses the message. So I've listed/included a number of *roles* below to give you an idea of the kind of work that goes into FreeSewing. It's not meant to be an exhaustive list, but merely a starting point for a discussion.

The order is alphabetic.

**Backend Developer**  
You keep our backend in step with the latest frontend developments. Express is no stranger to you. Node JS is a good friend. Or maybe you'd like them to be.

**Body Ambassador**  
Maybe you're unusually short or tall. Maybe you have a bit of a pot belly or very large breasts. Maybe you have a disability that requires fit adjustments. Whatever it is, you represent a minority fitting issue, and are willing to act as an ambassador to make sure your needs are heard and understood.

**Community Builder**  
You're an extrovert extraordinaire, or you're good at faking it. You enjoy chatting with all sorts of people, and networking is just you doing you. You're like the jelly that molds a group of individuals into a cohesive community.

**Database Administrator**  
You look after our database. Other people might feel that's not important, but you know better. You're familiar with MongoDB.

**Devops Engineer**  
Your aim is to make almost all these other roles irrelevant by automating the heck out of everything. CI and Github actions are fun for you. You like to sit back and have the robots do the work for you.

**Frontend Developer**  
You improve our websites, specifically freesewing.org and freesewing.dev. Both of them are built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), an open source framework for building frontends that is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/). If you know these things, or would like to learn them, this is your jam.

**Illustrator**  
You create illustrations to go alongside the written documentation. If you draw a bicycle from memory, it actually looks like a bicycle.

**Inclusion & Diversity Manager**  
You have skin in the game when it comes to inclusion and diversity. You'll help make our community welcoming and diverse. You won't be afraid to tell this pasty white dude when he's wrong.

**Language Ambassador**  
You represent FreeSewing in a non-English community. You can help answer questions or triage problem reports. Or you can point out where translations are missing.

**Pattern Ambassador**  
You'll be responsible for a specific FreeSewing design/pattern. You'll be *the person* to ask questions about how to make that pattern. You'll make sure the documentation is not forgotten. And you can help with questions or triage problem reports to developers or designers.

**Pattern Designer**  
You come up with new pattern designs for FreeSewing. You might not know how to turn on a computer, but damn if you can't draft a bodice.

**Pattern Developer**  
You program new designs for FreeSewing. You might not know how to design sewing patterns, but you're not afraid of Javascript and are happy to team up with a designer to work on a new pattern together.

**Proofreader**  
You check original English text of translations for typos and/or grammar mistakes. You propose improvements and watch over a consistent style and tone across FreeSewing's documentation and written text. You're fluent in the language you're proofreading.

**Social Media Platform Manager**  
You represent FreeSewing on a *platform*, where platform could be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, Reddit &hellip;. You manage the FreeSewing account on the platform, and use it to interact with the community.

**System Administrator** You look after our servers. You install updates, make sure certificates are up-to-date, the works. Linux is where your heart lies. You secretly automated most of your work with Ansible but hey, you put the playbooks in Git so no worries.

**Technical Writer (code)**  
You write documentation for freesewing.dev, our developers website. You have good writing skills and familiarity with code (Javascript).

**Technical Writer (sewing)**  
You write documentation for freesewing.org, our makers website. You have good writing skills and are familiarity with sewing.

**Translator**  
You translate FreeSewing into one of its additional languages (French, German, Dutch, Spanish) or if you're ambitious, add a new one. You're fluent in the language you're translating to, and have a good grasp of English.

**UX Designer**  
You know what UX is and are happy to point out where it sucks and how it can be made better.

**Release Manager**  
You pull the plug on new releases, you bundle our code, and publish new versions of our packages on NPM.

**Web Designer**  
You know how to make things pretty, even if you're not sure how to actually make them work.  You appreciate that we don't use #000 for black.

### What's in it for me?

We can't offer you money. Please [read our revenue pledge](/docs/about/pledge/) to understand why that is.

What we can offer is responsibility, recognition, and a stake in something that strives to be a force for good in this world.

It can also be an excellent learning opportunity for those of you who would like to pivot to a role in web development. And for as far as my time stretches — I will gladly teach and mentor people from underprivileged communities aiming for social mobility.

## Conclusion

Maybe you can help. Maybe you know somebody who can help, or for whom this would be a valuable learning experience.

Either way, I'd appreciate it if you could help spread the message that I'm asking for help.

Thank you,

Joost
