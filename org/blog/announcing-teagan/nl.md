Een tijdje geleden vroeg iemand of we een t-shirtpatroon hadden op FreeSewing, en toen bleek dat niet zo te zijn.

Daar is geen goede reden voor, het is er gewoon nooit van gekomen. Dus vandaag lanceren we versie 2.9 van FreeSewing, met ons nieuwste patroon: [het Teagan t-shirt](/designs/teagan/).

## Voor wie is dit?

Teagan is fitted T-shirt pattern with options for altering the neckline, length, and sleeves.

Teagan is based on [our Brian block](/designs/brian/), which does not take breasts into account. That being said, this will work for people with breasts too. Since it uses the chest circumference it will simply draft a T-shirt to fit your full chest.

We've also added an option to draft this to your high bust, which would give you a more fitted T-shirt with ease & stretch having to accomodate for your breasts.
