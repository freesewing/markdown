A while ago I found myself in need of some new swim trunks. So I drafted a pattern and made some:

![An early tryout of the Shin pattern](sample.jpg)

I asked if people would be interested in a pattern like this, and turns out that yes, they were.

So, after some more tweaking, I think this is ready for you guys, and meanwhile Roy has already provided an illustration for it too.

## Options and documentation available

Shin comes with options, and they are very close to the options available for [Bruce](/patterns/bruce).

All [options are documented](/docs/patterns/shin/options), as are the [required measurements](/docs/patterns/shin/measurements), and I've also written [instructions for how to make this](/docs/patterns/shin).

I still have to do the illustrations, but it's really not hard so you'll probably figure it out without them. Essentially, you can go and make this right now.

Enjoy!
