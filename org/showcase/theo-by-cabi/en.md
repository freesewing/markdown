This is a adaption of the Theo pattern. I left out the zipper and the buttons. 
Instead of this I filled the waistband with a elastic.

The intention of this trousers were to have a nice sloppy trousers at home. 
But with the linen fabric and its colour the trousers still hold the classic chic of the pattern. 
Now I wear them at work and funsies.
