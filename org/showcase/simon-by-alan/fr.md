Alan jumped right in the sewing deep end with this Simon shirt, with very impressive results!

Alan shared:

> This Simon shirt is the first piece of clothing that I have ever sewn. I decided to try for short sleeves since where I live is pretty much summer from March-October. I really struggled attaching the sleeves, and they came out a bit funky. As I was sewing this, making mistake after mistake, ripping seams and doing them over, I fully expected it to look horrible. I am very happy with how it turned out for my first shirt. I can't wait to try another or maybe the Hugo hoodie. Anyways... thanks for this awesome site!
