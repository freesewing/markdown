Anna shared this terrific Simon shirt with us! Anna said:

> At long last, this project is finished: a men's collared dress shirt!  It is made of gingham medium-weight linen, so it will be perfect for summertime.  I got to practice lots of hand-sewing and tailoring with this project, and am so pleased with how it turned out.

We just love the fabric choice, details, and great modeling.
