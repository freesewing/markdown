## Why do I need to create an account just to download a pattern?

For practical reasons. As we generate made-to-measure sewing patterns, we need your measurements to generate a pattern for you. We also need to know whether you use metric or imperial units.

Asking you this information every time would be rather tedious, so we need to store this information. And your account is where we do that.

So while we could in principle build this site in such a way that an account is not required, it would just be hopelessly inpractical.

##### Are you asking because you don't trust us?

This question often hints at an underlying distrust towards creating an account. As such, the following questions and answers may also be relevant:

- [What are you doing with my personal data?](#what-are-you-doing-with-my-personal-data)
- [Who pays for all of this?](#who-pays-for-all-of-this)
- [What's your end game?](#whats-your-end-game)

## I know my size. So why do I have to enter my measurements?

Drafting made-to-measure sewing patterns really is *our thing*.  
If you insist on getting a pattern in a standard size, FreeSewing is not for you.

No need to despair though, Fiona curates [a list of indie pattern designers](https://chainstitcher.blogspot.com/p/about-blog.html) and to the best of our knowledge, FreeSewing is the only one on that list to not provide sewing patterns in standardized sizes.

## What are you doing with my personal data?

How we handle your personal data is documented in [our privacy notice](/docs/about/privacy/).

## Who pays for all of this?

The FreeSewing project is supported financially by [our patrons](/patrons).

Patrons are regular users like you who agreed to make a small monthly contribution to keep freesewing going.

You can be a patron for as little as 2 euro per month. So why not [become a patron](/patrons/join) too?

## What's your end game?

We would like freesewing.org to become the WikiPedia of sewing patterns.

We are not interested in fashion, trends, or publishing the hot new pattern of the season. Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community into patterns and documentation and make that information globally available.
