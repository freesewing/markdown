Turn this setting off to only draft a basic outline of the pattern.

This is useful particularly for people looking to use a laser cutter or other automated tools, and only want the cutlines of the pattern.

<Note>

If you're working with a complex pattern, this can also help (a bit) to keep re-rendering snappy.
