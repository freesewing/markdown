**Dernière mise à jour**: 23 Mai 2018

## À propos

Cette politique de confidentialité décrit les données personnelles que nous stockons. Cela explique pourquoi nous avons besoin de ces données, combien de temps nous les conserverons et si nous les partageons avec des tiers.

Nous sommes convaincus que ça prouve notre engagement en faveur de la protection de la vie privée.

## Partie 1 : Comment nous utilisons vos données personnelles

Pour plus de clarté, nous avons divisé ceci en trois types de rôles différents :

 - Pour les visiteurs, nous stockons [données de visiteur](#visitor-data)
 - Pour les utilisateurs, nous stockons [données de profil](#profile-data)
 - For users with one or more models, we store [model data](#model-data)

These roles are cumulative. If you are a user, you are also a visitor. And if you are a user with one or more models, you are also a user, and also a visitor.

<Note>

#### Visitor data

 - **What personal data do we store?**
   - Your IP address
 - **Why do we need it?**
   - Your IP address is logged on our backend systems. We use these logs and the information in them only to diagnose problems.
 - **How long do we keep it?**
   - We keep these logs for 6 months.
 - **Do we share it?**
   - No, never.

This data is stored for anybody who visits our website or connects to our backend APIs.

</Note>

<Note>

#### Profile data

 - **What personal data do we store?**
   - Your E-mail address
   - Your username and password
   - Optional: A profile picture, bio, and your social media accounts
 - **Why do we need it?**
   - To authenticate you
   - To be able to contact you when required
   - Optional: We don't need a picture or your social media accounts, but they help to build an on-line community
 - **How long do we keep it?**
   - We keep profile data up to 12 months after your last login, or until you remove it.
 - **Do we share it?**
   - No, never.

This data is stored for anybody with an account on our website.

</Note>

<Note>

#### Model data

 - **What personal data do we store?**
   - Body measurements
   - Whether the model has breasts or not
   - Optional: An avatar for the model
 - **Why do we need it?**
   - We need the body measurements to draft made-to-measure sewing patterns
   - We use the information about whether a model has breasts to only show relevant measurements when configuring the model
   - The model avatar only serves to help you differentiate between your different models
 - **How long do we keep it?**
   - We keep model data up to 12 months after your last login, or until you remove it.
 - **Do we share it?**
   - We never share personal model data
   - We publish an open data set of measurements, containing fully anonymized data.

This data is stored for anybody with an account on our website which contains one or more models.

</Note>

## Part 2: Other topics

### Full disclosure

If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform both you and the authorities.

If you believe your personal data has been compromised, please contact joost@decock.org.


### Service Providers

Our hosting provider manages our backend systems for us. This includes hosting, storage, and backup.

While this means they process your data (in the strict sense of the word), they do not require access to information about you. Furthermore, as we encrypt profile data at rest, it is non-trivial for them to access it even if they wanted to.

### Law enforcement

While we have no intention of sharing any of your personal data, we are not above the law.

If we are required to do so by law, or if we feel that doing so would be the lesser evil, we will disclose personal data.

So far, we have not received any request from law enforcement to disclose information about one of our users. We have also not disclosed any personal information for any other reason.

### Use by minors under the age of 16

You need to be at least 16 years old to use freesewing.

### Data Controller and Contact information

For questions about this privacy notice, you can contact Joost De Cock at joost@decock.org.

### Changes and Updates to this Policy

This policy may be updated occasionally. We will indicate this in the **Last update** data at the top of this document.
