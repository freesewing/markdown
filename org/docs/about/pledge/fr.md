## Pourquoi nous faisons cela

### Noblesse oblige

You probably assume that we ask for money to keep the servers running. Mais ce n'est pas tout à fait vrai.

Je ne sais pas si vous êtes familier avec l'expression **noblesse oblige** mais cela signifie essentiellement que le privilège implique une responsabilité.

I am privileged, and thus I have responsibilities. I am very fortunate to have been born in Western Europe, have a good job, and a roof over my head.

ould I use the money? Yes I could. Do I need the money? No I don't.

### The value of your support

The main risk to FreeSewing is the same as any open source project out there: maintainer burnout.

While I no longer carry FreeSewing alone — and I can't overstate the value of the work of all contributors — that doesn't make me immune to feelings of *Why the hell am I doing this?*

When people become Patrons (or donate), they give more than money. To me, the main value is the message they send to me and other people working on this. And that message is: *Hey, you're doing a worthwhile thing. Keep up the good work*.

### The value of your money

It is not *just* about the money. But that doesn't mean the money is not important. Much to the contrary.

Raising money by doing something I love and then passing it on to charity allows me to sleep at night.

I could volunteer at a soup kitchen, or teach underprivileged children how to sew. But instead I’m working on FreeSewing.

Which is why all the money raised through FreeSewing goes to charity. It makes this project not only fun to do, but also socially responsible. And I need that to convince myself that yes, it's ok to spend all my time doing this, because at the end of the year, I get to write a check to people who need it so much more.

### Charity is not sexy
Here's the tricky part: People give less once they know the money goes to charity in the end. I wish it wasn't the case, but it is.

So we're presenting [our subscription options](/patrons/join) like you would see on a for-profit site. It seems more intuitive this way, and also just works better.

Yes, everything is free, and the money doesn't actually go to paying the server bills (because I choose to pay them out of my pocket for reasons outlined above). But that doesn't mean that these contributions are not crucial to the well-being of the project, or at the very least its maintainer (that would be me).

## What charity does the money go to?

There's a lot of misery in the world. As I watch the news, I often feel my faith in humanity slipping.

Some of the most vulnerable people on this planet seem largely abandoned by rich countries and supra-national organisations.

Yet somehow, in some of those worst places to be a human being, there is still a banner flying that provides hope, and help. It's not the flag of the United Nations, nor is it the star spangled banner, or the blue and gold of the European Union.

The one thing that reminds me that humanity has not completely forsaken these people is to see the banner of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/Doctors Without Borders fly, precariously, among the rubble of their bombed hospitals.

I can't think of a single symbol that reminds us that not everything is lost, and there's still good people out there. I can't think of a single organisation more deserving of our support.

So I am happy to make this pledge.

In practice, all revenue received in the previous 12 months will be transfered to MSF once per year, on the 10th of December.
