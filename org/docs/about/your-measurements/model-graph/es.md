A so-called *model-graph* is a visual representation of a model's measurements:

![Example](model.png)

Measurements of width (neck circumference, chest circumference, and so on) are represented in the circle on the left. Measurements of height (length of the arms, inseam, and so on) are represented with the bars on the right.

Once the neck circumference measurement is known, the graph will not only show all the measurements you have entered, it will also include a project of the missing measurements, based on the model's neck circumference.

## Why we made this graph

A common problem is for people to make mistakes while taking measurements. We wanted to address that problem, but setting boundaries on what any given measurement will accept opens the door to rejecting measurements for correctly measured yet uniquely sized bodies.

So rather than setting boundaries, we opted to map out a model's measurements in comparison to the industry-standard sizing charts for any given neck circumference.

This allows you to spot outliers, so you can make your own judgement call on whether you should perhaps re-measure, or that this is ok. After all, chances are that if (some of) your measurements are significantly different from what the garment industry expects, you already knew that.

## How to read the chart

Your relative size is represented by the size of the circle. The bigger the circle, the higher you are in the sizing chart. Your proportions are captured in the shape of the circle. The more it looks like a perfect circle, the closer your proportions are to sizing chart used in the industry.

Your height, and vertical measurements, are plotted at bars extending to the right. The farther they reach, the taller you are. The dashed line marks what the industry expects for someone with your neck circumference. If a bar surpasses it, that indicates you are taller, or that measurement is longer, than the standard sizing chart.

If your bars stop short of  the dashed line, you are shorter than what the industry expects.

## What to look out for

The purpose of the graph is to spot mistakes in your measurements. So look for anything that stands out. A spike or deep dent in the circle, or a bar that is significantly longer or shorter than the others.

It doesn't mean these measurements are incorrect, it's merely a suggestion to double-check them to make sure you have them measured correctly.
