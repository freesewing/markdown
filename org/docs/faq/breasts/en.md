title: "What's all this talk about with or without breasts?"
---

Some people get confused by the terms _with breasts_ and _without breasts_.

We use these terms as a gender-inclusive way to ask whether or not a person has breasts.

##### As it applies to bodies
Nearly every clothing company has two main categories for their clothing: menswear and womenswear. 
These garment designs are usually based off of the ideal or average body. 
Meaning, for womenswear, the designer will likely make a garment for a body with breasts, 
narrow shoulders, a smaller waist and wide hips. 

These characteristics are generally thought of as _the typical characteristics of a woman's body_. 
However, we believe it is best to stay away from this; 
no body is average and we want to build a gender-inclusive environment. 

We do not want to exclude anyone and we don't agree with the idea that _body shape = gender_. 
That's why we use the terminology **with breasts** and **without breasts**, 
simply asking whether a person has breast tissue or not.

##### How it applies to patterns
We use the terms menswear and womenswear too, but merely to label whether a garment
projects a more masculine or feminine style.

In general, patterns labelled as _womenswear_ tend to require measurments that are
only relevant for people with breasts.

Any user can draft any pattern on our site, as long as they provide the 
required measurements. Which for some womenswear patterns includes measurements
that are only relevant if you have breasts.
