title: With or without breasts?
order: 250
---

Some people get confused by the terms **with breasts** and **without breasts**.

We use these terms as a gender-inclusive way to ask whether or not a person has breasts.

As you navigate the FreeSewing site, you'll find patterns drafted to take breasts into
account, patterns that are drafted without breasts, and patterns that have options for both.
In general, patterns labelled as "Menswear" are drafted without breasts, and patterns
labelled as "Womenswear" are drafted with breasts, but any user can draft any pattern to
their measurements.

<Note>

##### Why we ask in the first place

Fitting a chest with breasts is more complex than fitting a chest without breasts. 
There are extra measurements and options required, and we want to display these
only when it's relevant.
