<Note>

###### Why we offer sizes even though we don't use them

FreeSewing does not use sizes. All our patterns are drafted to a set of measurements.

Since version 2.2 however, we do provide *standard sizes*. 
Each size is a set of measurements that is an estimation of what a person with a given
neck circumference could have as measurements.

This is not an exact science. We provide these sizes as a fast and easy way to 
get started with our patterns. But we do hope that you will take the time to take
your own measurements, or have them taken. This will always yield better results.

###### Not a fan of horizontal scolling?

There's a lot of information in the tables below, causing the table to overflow.
You can scroll horizontally to get to the rest of the data.

Of, if you'd like, you can also [show sizes in a wide view](/sizes/).
