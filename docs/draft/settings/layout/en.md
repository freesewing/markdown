Our layout builder allows you to manually configure the layout for the pattern.

There are different scenario's where this is useful:

 - You are not happy with the default layout, and want to re-arrange things to save paper
 - You want to have your pattern printed on a large-format printer and want to arrange it to fit on it's paper size
 - You want to know exactly how much fabric you want to buy by aligning all pattern parts within the width of your fabric

The layout builder allows you to set the pattern width manually, and will adapt the pattern height for you.

You can then manually move parts around, rotate them, or even flip them vertically or horizontally.

To do so, select a pattern part. You can drag it to move. Or use the icons at the top right to
rotate, or flip it.

When you're happy with your layout, click the button on the bottom to apply your layout.
